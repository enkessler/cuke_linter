Feature: Test with setup step after action step linter

  As a tester
  I want to be warned about abnormal step flows
  So that the tests make sense


  Scenario: Linting

  Note: Also works on outlines. Does not include steps inherited from backgrounds.

    Given a linter for tests with a setup step after an action step
    And the following feature:
      """
      Feature:

        Scenario:
          When action step
          Given an out of place setup step
      """
    When it is linted
    Then an error is reported:

      | TestWithSetupStepAfterActionStepLinter | Test has 'Given' step after 'When' step. | <path_to_file>:3 |

    Given a linter for tests with a setup step after an action step has been registered
